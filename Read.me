To determine if a client will receive a loan from the bank, two models were built-- a random forest classifier model and a logistic regression model. 
First, both logistic regression and randomforestclassifier must be installed from sklearn. 
Second, a train/test split must be determined for all x and y values in order to build each model. 
Then, both models were able to be built and tested. 
From the models, both a training score and testing score were able to determined. Using the scores, the best model was able to be picked.
